    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>must be what it’s like when you get up on stage to accept an award, only to
        realize you’ve left the list of people you have to thank in your other trousers:
        You’re guaranteed to forget someone, and that music will soon start rolling to
        quickly usher you off the stage.
        So that being said, here’s the (no doubt) incomplete list of people to whom I owe
        a huge debt of gratitude for helping make this book as good as I think it now is.
        Thanks to the No Starch team, particularly Bill Pollock, for applying a liberal
        dose of “what-would-a-kid-think” while editing it. When you’ve been
        programming for a long time, it’s all too easy to forget how difficult some of this
        stuff is for learners, and Bill was invaluable at pointing out those oft-overlooked,
        over-complicated parts. And thanks to Serena Yang, production manager
        extraordinaire; here’s hoping you haven’t torn out too much hair getting 300+
        pages of code correctly colorized</p>
